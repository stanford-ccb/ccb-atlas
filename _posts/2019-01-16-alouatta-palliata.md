The mantled howler monkey is located in the lowlands and montane rainforests of Latin America. They typically weight between 3 to 9 kilograms and feed on leaves, fruits and flowers. The species is endangered in certain areas, but evidence suggests that their numbers are increasing in tere aras. They live for about 25 years in the wild and females breed roughly every 22 and a half months, and each female tends to have one offspring per litter. These monkeys spend most of their time foraging for food, which leads to a farily conservative lifestyle. Habitat loss and natural disasters are the main immediate threats to these monkeys.
